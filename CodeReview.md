# Deliverable Information
   > Please include your answers below in a good format so it is easy for me to see. For answers to questions please use these Blockquotes. Make sure you also check the kickoff document for more details. Also make sure this thing is well formatted and the links are links in here. 

## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose**: Gym scheduling

**Sprint Number**: 1

**Scrum Master**: Clinton Bell

**Git Master**: Sam Rondinelli

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-3)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation. 

**Sprint Goal:** Understanding the main features of Memoranda and fixing obvious bugs

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:**  3

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 
> 2

**Why did you add these US, why do you think you can get them done in the next Sprint?**

> We added these stories because they will help us achieve our sprint goal of understanding the software, primarily the UI. We also added the US pertaining to the version and build number so that our team can easily reference what version is being worked on.

**Why do you think these fit well with your Sprint goal? (details)**

> These fit well with our sprint goal because they will require us to dive into the code and to identify small things that will increase familiarity with the software.

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> Yes. We have added what we perceive to be the pressing tasks that will help us achieve our sprint goal.



## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2 and Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that). 

| Date  | Attendees  |Meeting notes (very brief)   | Burndown Info (on track, ahead behind is enough) | TravisCI info (does the master pass) | Additional Info  |

That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."
